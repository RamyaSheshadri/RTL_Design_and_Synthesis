# RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop using SKY130 🚀

## 🧠 Overview

This repository documents my journey through the **RTL Design & Synthesis Workshop using SKY130**, based on the open-source flow by [Prachurjya Ghy](https://github.com/prachurjyaghy/RTL_Design_and_Synthesis_Workshop_Using_SKY130). It covers the **complete front-end ASIC design flow** using open-source tools like:

- 🛠️ **Icarus Verilog** – RTL simulation
- 📈 **GTKWave** – Waveform analysis and debugging
- ⚙️ **Yosys** – RTL synthesis
- 🧱 **Sky130 PDK** – Industry-grade open-source standard cell library

This project helps me **build practical VLSI design experience**, aligned with real industry flows and tools used at companies like **Intel, Synopsys, Cadence, AMD**, and more.

## 🎯 Goal

To learn and implement a complete RTL-to-Gate-Level design flow from scratch using:
> 🖊️ Verilog → 🧪 Simulation → 🔧 Synthesis → 📐 (Optional) GDSII with OpenLane

Each session is documented in its own folder with:
- ✅ Clean Verilog code
- ✅ Testbenches
- ✅ Simulation waveforms
- ✅ Synthesis reports
- ✅ Learnings and commands used

## 💬 Why This Matters (for VLSI Placements)

- Gain **hands-on experience** with real ASIC design flow
- Practice using **industry-parallel tools**
- Build a **portfolio-ready GitHub repo**
- Show off understanding of **RTL → Netlist → (GDS)** pipeline
- Stand out in interviews for roles like RTL Design Engineer, Digital IC Engineer, Frontend Verification, etc.
