# RTL Design and Synthesis using SKY130 üöÄ

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through the **RTL Design & Synthesis Workshop using SKY130**, based on the open-source flow by [Prachurjya Ghy](https://github.com/prachurjyaghy/RTL_Design_and_Synthesis_Workshop_Using_SKY130).  I have extended it with my own documentation, notes, and experiments.It covers the **complete front-end ASIC design flow** using open-source tools like:

- **Icarus Verilog** ‚Äì RTL simulation
- **GTKWave** ‚Äì Waveform analysis and debugging
- **Yosys** ‚Äì RTL synthesis
- **Sky130 PDK** ‚Äì Industry-grade open-source standard cell library

This project helps me **build practical VLSI design experience**, aligned with real industry flows and tools used at companies like **Intel, Synopsys, Cadence, AMD**, and more.

## Goal

To learn and implement a complete RTL-to-Gate-Level design flow from scratch using:
> Verilog ‚Üí  Simulation ‚Üí  Synthesis ‚Üí (Optional) GDSII with OpenLane

# Session 1 ‚Äî 2-input AND Gate RTL Design, Simulation & Waveform

This session covers writing the RTL and testbench for a 2-input AND gate, simulating the design using Icarus Verilog, and viewing the waveform on GTKWave.


### -Project Setup
 #### -Create a working directory for the session:
  - mkdir -p ~/sky130_workshop/session1
  - cd ~/sky130_workshop/session1

  
-Create RTL File
 -Open design.v in nano editor:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano design.v
Paste the following RTL code:

verilog
Copy
Edit
module and_gate(
  input a, b,
  output y
);
  assign y = a & b;
endmodule
Save and exit:

Press Ctrl + O, then Enter to save

Press Ctrl + X to exit

üìù Create Testbench File
bash
Copy
Edit
nano tb.v
Paste the following testbench:

verilog
Copy
Edit
`timescale 1ns/1ps
module tb;
  reg a, b;
  wire y;
  and_gate uut (.a(a), .b(b), .y(y));

  initial begin
    $dumpfile("and_gate.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0, tb);
    
    a = 0; b = 0; #10;
    a = 1; b = 0; #10;
    a = 0; b = 1; #10;
    a = 1; b = 1; #10;
    $finish;
  end
endmodule
Save and exit with Ctrl + O, Enter, Ctrl + X.

‚öôÔ∏è Compile and Simulate
Compile both design and testbench files:

bash
Copy
Edit
iverilog design.v tb.v -o sim.out
Run the compiled simulation:

bash
Copy
Edit
vvp sim.out
This will generate a file called and_gate.vcd.

üìà Open GTKWave (for Waveform Visualization)
If you're on WSL, ensure your X11 server (e.g., VcXsrv) is running.

Export display (for WSL only):

bash
Copy
Edit
export DISPLAY=:0
Then open the waveform in GTKWave:

bash
Copy
Edit
gtkwave and_gate.vcd
Inside GTKWave:

Navigate the left panel and double-click a, b, and y to load them into the waveform viewer.

Zoom and inspect signal transitions as needed.

‚úÖ Status
At this point:

The Verilog RTL and testbench have been simulated

Output waveform is successfully viewed

Environment is fully functional
