# RTL Design and Synthesis using SKY130 ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through the **RTL Design & Synthesis Workshop using SKY130**, based on the open-source flow by [Prachurjya Ghy](https://github.com/prachurjyaghy/RTL_Design_and_Synthesis_Workshop_Using_SKY130).  I have extended it with my own documentation, notes, and experiments.It covers the **complete front-end ASIC design flow** using open-source tools like:

- **Icarus Verilog** â€“ RTL simulation
- **GTKWave** â€“ Waveform analysis and debugging
- **Yosys** â€“ RTL synthesis
- **Sky130 PDK** â€“ Industry-grade open-source standard cell library

This project helps me **build practical VLSI design experience**, aligned with real industry flows and tools used at companies like **Intel, Synopsys, Cadence, AMD**, and more.

## Goal

To learn and implement a complete RTL-to-Gate-Level design flow from scratch using:
> Verilog â†’  Simulation â†’  Synthesis â†’ (Optional) GDSII with OpenLane
