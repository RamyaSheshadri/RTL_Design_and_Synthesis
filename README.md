# RTL Design and Synthesis using SKY130 

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through the **RTL Design & Synthesis Workshop using SKY130**, based on the open-source flow by [Prachurjya Ghy](https://github.com/prachurjyaghy/RTL_Design_and_Synthesis_Workshop_Using_SKY130).  I have extended it with my own documentation, notes, and experiments.It covers the **complete front-end ASIC design flow** using open-source tools like:

- **Icarus Verilog** – RTL simulation
- **GTKWave** – Waveform analysis and debugging
- **Yosys** – RTL synthesis
- **Sky130 PDK** – Industry-grade open-source standard cell library

This project helps me **build practical VLSI design experience**, aligned with real industry flows and tools used at companies like **Intel, Synopsys, Cadence, AMD**, and more.

## Goal

To learn and implement a complete RTL-to-Gate-Level design flow from scratch using:
> Verilog →  Simulation →  Synthesis → (Optional) GDSII with OpenLane

# Session 1 — 2-input AND Gate RTL Design, Simulation & Waveform

This session covers writing the RTL and testbench for a 2-input AND gate, simulating the design using Icarus Verilog, and viewing the waveform on GTKWave.


### Project Setup
 #### Create a working directory for the session:
  - mkdir -p ~/sky130_workshop/session1
  - cd ~/sky130_workshop/session1

  #### Create RTL File
  - Open design.v in nano editor:using command : nano design.v
  - Write your RTL code inside it
    - Save and exit:
    - Press Ctrl + O, then Enter to save
    - Press Ctrl + X to exit
      
#### Create Testbench File
Use command:nano tb.v
 - Write Testbench code in it.
  - Save and exit with Ctrl + O, Enter, Ctrl + X.

#### Compile and Simulate
Compile both design and testbench files:
iverilog design.v tb.v -o sim.out

#### Run the compiled simulation:
vvp sim.out
This will generate a file called and_gate.vcd.

### Open GTKWave (for Waveform Visualization)
If you're on WSL, ensure your X11 server (e.g., VcXsrv) is running.

### Export display (for WSL only):
export DISPLAY=:0
Then open the waveform in GTKWave:
gtkwave and_gate.vcd

- Inside GTKWave:
- Navigate the left panel and double-click a, b, and y to load them into the waveform viewer.
- Zoom and inspect signal transitions as needed.

#### Status:
At this point:
- The Verilog RTL and testbench have been simulated
- Output waveform is successfully viewed
- Environment is fully functional

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. Write RTL and Testbench
- `good_mux.v`:using command nano good_mux.v 
- tb_good_mux.v:using command nano tb_good_mux.v
- Ctrl+O to save, ENTER, Ctrl+X to exit

### 2. Run simulation:
- iverilog -o mux_out good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
- vvp mux_out
- gtkwave dump.vcd &

Observe a, b, sel, and y in GTKWave.

### 3. Run synthesis in Yosys by:
yosys
**Then in yosys shell, type the following commands one by one**
- read_liberty -lib sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
- read_verilog good_mux.v
- synth -top good_mux
- dfflibmap -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
- abc -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
- show


 ## **synth -top good_mux**

### Inference from `stat` Output — Before ABC Mapping

* **Module name** is `good_mux` — your top-level design
* **4 wires and 4 wire bits** → represent the signals `a`, `b`, `sel`, `y`
* **No memories or processes** → confirms it's a purely combinational design (no FSMs or RAM)
* **Number of cells: 1** → only one logic unit used internally
* **`$_MUX_` is present** → this is a *generic inferred mux* from Yosys
* Not yet mapped to real SKY130 cells — design is still in **intermediate netlist form**
* Indicates you haven’t run `abc` (or `dfflibmap + abc`) yet to tech-map to real standard cells

---

### Summary:
MUX design has successfully synthesized to one internal multiplexer (`$_MUX_`), but it's not yet mapped to any **actual SKY130 standard cell**. Run `abc` to replace `$_MUX_` with `sky130_fd_sc_hd__mux2_1` or equivalent.


## ABC RESULTS: sky130_fd_sc_hd__mux2_1 cells: 1

### Inference from `stat` Output — **After ABC Mapping**

* The design is now **technology-mapped** to the SKY130 cell library
* **`sky130_fd_sc_hd__mux2_1`** is the actual physical standard cell used
* The previously inferred `$_MUX_` has been **replaced** with a real gate
* This means your RTL was successfully synthesized to a **tapeout-valid cell**
* Since only 1 cell was used, it's an **area-optimized** mapping — no redundant gates
* All inputs/outputs are **connected directly to the mux2\_1 cell**
* Ready for STA, power, area, and layout-level analysis

## Inference from `.yosys_show.dot` Gate-Level Diagram
### General Structure:
* The diagram is generated after running:show in Yosys **after `abc` + `.lib` tech mapping**.
---

### Key Observations:

* Inputs `a`, `b`, and `sel` are **connected via buffers (BUF)** — these are inserted by Yosys to match driving strength or syntax.
* The core logic cell is:
  ```
  sky130_fd_sc_hd__mux2_1
  ```
  This is a **real physical MUX gate** from the SKY130 standard cell library.
* Inputs:
  * `A0` = `a`
  * `A1` = `b`
  * `S` = `sel` (select line)

* Output:

  * `X` = result from MUX → passed to another `BUF` → output `y`
---

### Design-Level Inference:

* Your RTL 2:1 MUX is now **fully mapped to silicon-usable gate** — no inferred logic remains.
* No internal logic (NANDs or INVs) needed — this is **area-optimized**, thanks to direct use of `mux2_1`.
* Each input and output is passed through `BUF` gates to ensure signal integrity — this is typical in standard-cell synthesis.

## Post-Synthesis Stats (`stat` Output)

After running the full Yosys synthesis flow with SKY130 technology mapping, the following statistics were obtained using the `stat` command:


=== good_mux ===

   Number of wires:                  8
   Number of wire bits:              8
   Number of public wires:           4
   Number of public wire bits:       4
   Number of memories:               0
   Number of memory bits:            0
   Number of processes:              0
   Number of cells:                  1
     sky130_fd_sc_hd__mux2_1         1

-  **Number of cells: 1**  
  - The entire design is implemented using **a single standard cell**, making it extremely area-efficient and minimal in gate count.

- **Mapped Cell: `sky130_fd_sc_hd__mux2_1`**  
  - This is a native **2:1 multiplexer** from the SKY130 standard cell library.  
  - The RTL was **perfectly matched** to this cell with no need for internal decomposition (e.g., into NAND, NOR, or INV gates).  
  - Result: A **clean and optimal** technology-mapped netlist.

- **8 wires / 8 wire bits**  
  - Represents a combination of internal connections and buffering handled by Yosys during synthesis.  
  - **Public wires: 4** → These are your actual RTL ports: `a`, `b`, `sel`, and `y`.

- **No memories or processes present**  
  - Confirms the design is **purely combinational** — no sequential elements, state machines, or RAM.  
  - Ideal for lightweight logic blocks and for STA or physical design integration.

---

### Takeaway

> The synthesized netlist is highly optimized, mapped to a single SKY130 mux2x1 gate (`sky130_fd_sc_hd__mux2_1`), with buffers added at input/output ports. and ready for further analysis or layout.  
> This confirms that the RTL design is clean, efficient, and silicon-valid for fabrication using open PDKs.
